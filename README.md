# Photogrammetry using Microsoft AirSim & Agisoft Metashape

This project demonstrates a **virtual photogrammetry workflow** using the [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) drone simulator.  
A virtual survey of the **Neighbourhood environment** was conducted using simulated drones, images were captured, and a **3D reconstruction** was performed using **Agisoft Metashape**.

---

## üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Drone Simulation with AirSim**
   - Configured multiple drones in `settings.json`.
   - Implemented **angled survey** (`AngledSurvey.py`) and **vertical survey** (`VerticalSurvey.py`) scripts for autonomous flight and image capture.

2. **Image Capture**
   - Drones follow predefined flight paths.
   - Capture high-resolution RGB images at intervals.
   - Store images in local directories.

3. **3D Reconstruction**
   - Captured images were imported into **Agisoft Metashape**.
   - Generated a **3D point cloud, textured mesh, and DEM** of the environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) (with Neighbourhood environment)
- [Agisoft Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) (for reconstruction)
- Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Simulation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/photogrammetry-airsim
   cd photogrammetry-airsim
   ```

2. Start the AirSim Neighbourhood environment.

3. Run the survey script:
   ```bash
   python AngledSurvey.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python VerticalSurvey.py
   ```

4. The captured images will be saved in the working directory.

5. Import the images into **Agisoft Metashape** (or any photogrammetry tool) to generate the 3D model.
